We failed the first test with these values:

Value: 343808108
Array: [176792303, 343808108, 360288723, 464644550, 863108844, 921438464, 1298530144, 1639132990, 1718738594, 1833889642, 1945741070, 1959630864]

We did some more testing and didn't find any bugs in contain, but we did see that binary search gave us the wrong answer.
We investigated binary search and found out that the method checked the wrong side of the index.
When the value was bigger it the looked at the left side instead of the right side and vice versa.
So we just switched places on left and right in the binarysSearch code to fix the bug.
