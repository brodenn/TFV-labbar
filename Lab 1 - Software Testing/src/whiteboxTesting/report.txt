Found a bug were the break statements inside the if-clauses causes the method to always reach the last line,
this makes it to add an element when not supposed to.

Fix: Replacing break with return

Found a bug were the index for the original set is incremented even though an elements was removed from it. 
This will make it jump over the next element and may lead to that an element that was supposed to be removed, still exists.

Fix:Remove i++ inside the first if-clause

Found a bug were member(2 * a.get(i) - a.get(j)) always will return true.
This is because when j and i is equal to 0,
 "2 * a.get(i) - a.get(j)" will take the first element times two minus itself witch equals itself. 
 And of course the elements exists that gives the return value true from member.
 
Fix: change the loop condition in the second for-node to j < i from j <= i
